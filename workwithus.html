             <p style="text-align:center">Over 20,000 trekkers trek with us every year, to remote corners of the Himalayas, making Indiahikes the Largest Trekking Community in India. </p><br>
             <p style="text-align:center">However, trekkers do not trek with us because we are the largest. They trek with us because of our beliefs, our passion for trekking and our core values. They see a stark difference between us and others.
       
                    It is with these values that we are defining the future of trekking in India. We do this in our everyday work. That is why working at Indiahikes is very rewarding. You see results of your effort immediately. The impact is big. The reach is far and wide. </p><br>
             
             <p style="text-align:center">  In this context read our work requirement below. The process to apply is also given below.</p><br>

    <h3>Team members we're looking for</h3><br>
    <p>Just like us, if you want to define the future of trekking in our country, there are three ways in which you may work with Indiahikes.</p><br>
      <p>* Work at our office<br><br>
* Work in the outdoors<br><br>
* Work from home</p><br>
      <p>While trekking is a passion, the main reason to work with us is to create an impact on the trekking world. You want your work to be noticed. You want to learn new skills. At the same time you are keen to grow Indiahikes.</p><br>
      <p>With this in mind, take a look at the open positions (on your left, click on any position) and choose one that may suit you best. Do not choose multiple options. </p>
