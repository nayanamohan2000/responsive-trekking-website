                           Unlike 2020, there is a silver lining of the vaccination drive in our country this year. We notice it reflecting in our registrations as well. 

Trekkers are signing up for treks from July onwards — our high adventure summer treks and monsoon treks. Buran Ghati, Rupin Pass, Bhrigu Lake, Pin Bhaba Pass, Valley of Flowers, Tarsar Marsar, Kashmir Great Lakes, Hampta Pass — these are treks that trekkers are planning for with the safety net of the vaccination drive. 

We do expect India to flatten the curve by July. So you can safely plan your treks around then. 

In fact, you’ll notice that many of the dates are already full, so plan your treks soon. 

In the worst case scenario, if things don’t pan out well, our cancellation policy will ensure you lose nothing even if you have to call off your trek. Read our cancellation policy here.

                            July, August and September are great months to do some of our best monsoon treks. These are the only months when high altitude treks in Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh are accessible to trekkers.

                           es, absolutely. Many solo trekkers join our teams and have wonderful experiences. They end up meeting like-minded people on the trek and don’t feel like they have come alone on the trek any more.<br>

Our pre-trek experience team ensures that you know your entire team well much before you actually head out on the trek.<br>

Additionally, we have several women trekkers who join us solo as well because of the safety they get with the Indiahikes team. You’re welcome to join us as a solo trekker too.

                            Many people are intimidated by the idea of a Himalayan trek. It’s true that there are very real risks and challenges.<br>

However, almost everyone can participate in a Himalayan, if they are physically fit and mentally prepared for their trek. Around 75% of our trekkers are beginners and they trek comfortably.<br>

What will really help you is that after you register your trek, the Indiahikes Pre-Trek Experience Team will guide you on how to prepare for the trek. They will give you a fitness routine to follow and guidance on what to bring for the trek. They will also put you in touch with the rest of your trekking team, so that you know your trek mates well in advance.<br>

Given that we have been introducing Himalayan treks to beginners since 2008, you’re in safe hands.
