      <h2>How the Atal Tunnel Impacts Trekking in India</h2>

      <p>Some text..</p>
        <p>Most trekkers are oblivious to the impact of Atal Tunnel on trekking in India.</p>

<p>This historic tunnel, which was inaugurated on October 3, 2020, starts from Solang Valley near Manali and ends near the grand Sissu waterfall in Lahaul. Till now, not many travellers knew about the Sissu waterfall. But now, Atal Tunnel puts it on the popular map. Similarly, it brings the spotlight on Lahaul and underlines how little information is available about this region.</p>
<p>
“You have not seen a setting as beautiful as Lahaul. It is very different from the stark beauty of Spiti. Lahaul is colourful, stark, yet differently beautiful. Even the villages are very interesting in the way they are laid out. They are steeped in culture,” says Arjun Majumdar, CEO and founder of Indiahikes, who explored these remote regions a few times, once as a young boy with his father and once with Indiahikes on an exploration.</p>
<p>
This piqued my curiosity. At Indiahikes, we run treks in some of the most picturesque parts of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir. But now, here is a region that’s different from all these, and we haven’t talked about it yet. Why?</p>
<p>
In response, Arjun Majumdar and Sandhya UC, the co-founder of Indiahikes, pull out the Leomann maps. Animated conversations about Lahaul and Spiti follow. They talk extensively about the treks, the people and the culture. They also talk about the arduous journeys, the challenges and road-blocks in that region. </p>
<p>
What’s the Significance of Atal Tunnel on Trekking in India
Here, a few facts are necessary to bring perspective to the gravity of Atal Tunnel.
        </p><p>
The project of Atal Tunnel was first announced by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on June 3, 2000. Its construction began only a decade later in June 2010 and it took a decade more to complete.</p>
<p>
Finally, on October 3, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Atal Tunnel. It drills a hole into the eastern Pir Panjal range making it possible to travel from the Manali side to Lahaul in 20 minutes!

      <h2>Can you Trek at High Altitude with High Blood Pressure?</h2>
      <h5>GAYATRI RANGANATHAN, &nbsp;June 15,&nbsp; 2021</h5>
<!--      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
        <img src="D:\6th sem web project\images\high-altitude-training-mountain-w1300h550.jpg" width="800" height="300">
        
      <p>At Indiahikes we pride ourselves to be the safest trekking organisation in India. It is natural that our conversations often revolve around how to make high altitude trekking a safer experience.</p>

Today, we discuss whether trekkers with high blood pressure levels can trek at high altitudes.
<p>
Very often, we are asked about why we take BP readings before trekkers start their treks. A lot of trekkers end up frustrated when we turn them around because of a severe rise in blood pressure.</p>
<p>
It’s an often misunderstood concept, yet something extremely prevalent among trekkers.
        </p><p>
Lakshmi Selvakumaran, our Head of Learning and Development team, estimates that there is at least one person with high blood pressure when we take BP readings at the start of the trek (that is one in 20).</p>
<p>
To understand this topic better, I spoke to a few experts at Indiahikes and outside. I interviewed Dr. Sreelakshmi Thirumoorthy at length. Dr Sree is our go-to medical practitioner. She is a high altitude trekker and a keen researcher on the effects of high altitude on human physiology.</p>
<p>
I also spoke to Sandhya UC, the co-founder of Indiahikes, Vijeet Shaw, a senior Trek Leader at Indiahikes and Reena Shah, an experienced high altitude trekker and physiotherapist.
        </p><p>
        Let’s start with the basics.</p>
<p>
How does altitude affect blood pressure levels?
“Having observed trekkers for over 12 years, I can say there is a direct impact of altitude on blood pressure,” says Sandhya UC, co-founder of Indiahikes.</p>
<p>
“We’ve seen that trekkers who have completely normal readings in the plains show higher BP readings when they reach the base camp. Many of them are surprised by this. But this is normal at high altitude,” continues Sandhya.</p>
<p>
Trekker and physiotherapist Reena Shah agrees. “My BP shot up to a reading of 190 (systolic) right at the base camp of Kedarkantha. I have a known case of hypertension. But it was in control without medication for over 4 months before my trek. I have been trekking for many years, and I’ve seen this happen to me at Sar Pass, Hampta Pass and most of my other treks,” she adds.</p>

      <h2> Precautionary Steps You MUST Take Before Choosing a Trek for the Summer</h2>
      <h5>Swathi Chatrapathy, &nbsp;May 20,&nbsp; 2021</h5>
<!--      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
        <img src="D:\6th sem web project\images\precautions-blog-banner.jpg" width="800" height="300">
        
      <p>1.Every summer, when high altitude treks open up (above 13,000 ft), within a couple of weeks, there are reports of mishaps, evacuations, even deaths. It worries us to see so many lives that can be saved being lost because of ignorance (choose to trek at the wrong time or with wrong people) or slow action (not responding to the symptoms).
        </p><p>
In this article, we share 5 steps that every trekker can follow to stay safe, no matter with whom and where they are trekking.</p>

In this article, we share 5 steps that every trekker can follow to stay safe, no matter with whom and where they are trekking.</p>
        <p>2. Completing a trek ‘at any cost’ is foolish
This is a sensitive topic, but a few weeks ago, many organisations ran the Buran Ghati and Rupin Pass treks, while Indiahikes called off a few batches. We shifted our trekkers to other treks or refunded them altogether.</p>
<p>
Many trekkers wrote back to us later, pointing and laughing that they completed the trek with other organisations.

I want to tell you honestly, it was not impossible to complete the trek. Heck, any trek can be accomplished at any time of the year! But at what cost? Did we want to risk an avalanche? A rockfall? Double the time required to cross a pass at 15,000 ft because of waist-deep snow? Extend the turn-around time, the trekking hours? Risk notorious post-noon weather in the mountains?</p>
        <p>3. How fit is fit enough?
            From how we see it, there are four levels of fitness when you’re on a trek.</p>
<p>
Level 0 is not preparing for a trek at all. It’s appalling but it is true that there are umpteen trekkers who go to the mountains with zero preparation. Since we at Indiahikes are extremely strict about fitness, we don’t see too many in this category. But in the mountains, there is a discernible difference between our trekkers and others, especially when others are at Level 0.</p>
<p>
Level 1 is being just about fit to manage to complete the trek. You struggle a bit, but not much. You make it to the top (from our experience most trekkers achieve this fitness level).
        </p><p>
Level 2 is being fit enough to enjoy your trek. You don’t feel exertion or the need to pay attention to your body. You have enough time to absorb the surroundings and make conversations while trekking (around 10% of our trekkers achieve this).
        </p><p>
Level 3 is when you are fit enough to comfortably face bad weather conditions, and trek that extra mile through snow and rain. Most trekkers who achieve this level of fitness are stoic about the weather, they accept it and embrace it (very few trekkers achieve this level of fitness).</p>

      <h2>Understand the Monsoon: Interview with a Meteorologist</h2>
      <h5>GAUTAM SINGH, &nbsp;June 10,&nbsp; 2021</h5>
<!--      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
        <img src="D:\6th sem web project\images\freepressjournal_import_2017_06_Rajmachi.jpg" width="800" height="300">
        
    
        <p>Most trekkers are oblivious to the impact of Atal Tunnel on trekking in India.</p>
<p>We’re entering the first week of June. Standing on my balcony, I see heavy clouds floating above the Bangalore skyline. The air is cooler than it was three days ago. An earthy scent hangs in the air. Monsoon is almost here. In fact, every afternoon it has been raining! 🙂 </p><p>

Given that the monsoon is officially in Kerala, today, I thought I’d deep dive a bit into the monsoon season, especially how it affects our Himalayan treks. 

To get my answers, I again got in touch with our expert meteorologist, who you may have seen recently on the news, sharing his views on the cyclones that affected the country. 
        </p><p>
His name is Akshay Deoras. He has been a forecaster for the past 11 years. He is also a researcher and a public speaker, pursuing his doctoral study at the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK. (You may remember him from this interview I did with him on How snowfall occurs in India). </p>
<p>
There were some deeper questions in my mind.  

How does the monsoon appear during the same week every year without fail? Was there more to it than the low and high pressure difference between the land and the sea?</p>
<p>
How come we can comfortably trek in J&K and Himachal, when its neighbour at Uttarakhand gets heavy rains? Was it just the natural progression of the monsoon, or was there something else at play here?
        </p>
<p>Why did Uttarakhand get such devastating floods during the monsoon of 2013? Was it just a cloud burst or was there something else behind this?

Over an hour-long conversation, Akshay Deoras gave me more insight about the Monsoon than what I could get from any reading.</p>
<p>
That conversation is what I want to share with you today. 

I’m laying it out as questions and answers so it’s easier for you. I start out with the basics, to help lay the foundation, and then deep dive a bit. </p>
