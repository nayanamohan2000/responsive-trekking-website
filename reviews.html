        <p>Although the feeling of just being amongst high mountains in that fresh air and silence holds very dear and it is almost impossible to put it in words, but if I have to, it will be the resilience of standing tall and high in any conditions, being humble and allowing hard working deserving climbers to see their magic from up close and being merciless with harsh weather and terrain.</p>
        <p>You never conquer the mountains, they allow you to see them from a little closer, only if you are prepared and ready to persevere even when things go haywire sometimes.</p><br>

        <p>It was an awesome experience. I was little worried initially as this was my first trek experience but, IndiaHikes made this a memorable one. I must say I enjoyed every moment of my trek and want to say 'Everyone must Trek'. :-)</p>
<p>
I really liked the support I received from IH team from the time I booked the trek, Firstly, Pratima's series of mails with enough details made me confident. what to take, what to rent, what fitness required, details on Altitude sickness etc. This was really helpful .</p><br><hr><br><br>

        <p>The trek itself was not very challenging, so for me it was more about being within nature than the trek itself. Indiahikes facilitated that link between self and nature incredibly, through activities like Hug a Tree. I also really enjoyed other activities, like the Navigation activity, which not only informed us of new technology but also instigated collaboration, teamwork and rarities such as analogue map-making skills. Such activities made my experience with Indiahikes stand out in comparison to my past treks.</p><br>

        <p>) Majorly, All the amazing activities that were conducted on trek. Redemption of one's connection with nature. </p><p>
2) Safety and health conditions were checked before the start and end of the day. No member was left behind at any times. </p><p>
3) The idea of green trails and taking back the waste along. Makes one realise how much of a damage we're being to the planet. Big thumbs up on that </p><p>
        4) Delicious Delicious food, especially the desserts. </p><p>
5) Amazing trek leaders. They were the peak reason for making this trek one beautiful unforgettable experience. </p><br>

        <p>I loved the entire experience:
The entire journey was so co-ordinated. Transport to and from the base camp, food, everything was taken care of, As a solo traveller, doing this for the first time, that was really appreciated. 

The trek leader Areeb, co-ordinator Share, guides Birupaji and Raju Bhai, and kitchen staff - what lovely people! Ever encouraging and helpful. I really enjoyed what they taught us about trekking, how to use equipment.Confident that I can even manage a solo trek now, although thr group experience is so fun.</p><br>

        <p>The details of the trek were briefed to us a day before starting the trek and made us mentally prepared even more for the trek.
A demo on how to use the GMX file and track our own routes was something really fascinating and gave me the confidence I can do any other trek on my own as well if I want to.</p><p>
The use of micro spikes and gaters was new to me and I enjoyed it.
The trek leaders were constantly in touch with us and fascinating us with their adventures on every step of the trek. Got to learn so many things from them on the trek.</p><br>

        <p>My India Hikes experience was just amazing. I noticed that you take the four value pillars very seriously and make sure you provide with the best to the trekkers. my experience with green tails had been very good. I now know how much of a pollution we cause and how people are careless when it comes to plastic consumption. I have understood all the hazardous waste that is dumped into our mountains causes harm not just to us but also to the entire eco-system. I actively participated in the green tails initiative during the trek and I feel this will remain with me for good. definitely is life changing</p><br>

        <p>From trekking in rain to snowfall, we experienced everything one would expect coming on a winter trek. We had such amazing trek guides and Aayushi, our trek leader was so energetic and motivating.Bonding with the people around me is what stood out for me the most. Talking to the guides about the culture and food in these places, about their previous trek experience. Making a good rapport with the technical guide on our summit day and having sliding race on our way back from the summit. .</p><br>
